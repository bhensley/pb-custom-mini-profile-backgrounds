Custom Mini-Profile Backgrounds
===============================

This is a [ProBoards](http://proboards.com) plugin.  It facilitates custom background images for each user's mini-profile.

Features
---------

* Individual user's may set a background-image for their own profile (edit profile -> personal tab).
* Staff, with permission, may edit an user's set background-image (or set an image themselves, for that user).
* Staff, when permitted, may create rules to apply background images to entire groups.  Members showing as part of that group will then receive that background image.
* Group-based background images may be set to either override or not override a user's personally-set background image.
